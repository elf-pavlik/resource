Vocab about Resources and ResourceTypes

## What's the difference?

A Resource anything that is an input to or an output from a process or transferred in an exchange. 
A ResourceType defines what type of thing the Resource is.

So, for example, most things offered for sale on an e-commerce site are ResourceTypes. 
The one in a box delivered to your door is a Resource.

Or the description of the book entitled "The Power of Babel: A Natural History of Language", ISBN ISBN-13: 978-0060520854, 
is a ResourceType. Your library may have two copies that you can check out. Those are Resources.

Or, if you can buy it or sell it or eat it or drive it, it's a Resource.

## ResourceTypes are a Taxonomy

That means they can be defined very broadly and generally and maybe vaguely, or they can be defined very narrowly, 
but fit into broader categories. Like the Tree of Life.

So, for example, you may want an apple. Or you may want a green apple. Or you may want a Granny Smith apple. 
Or you may want a Granny Smith apple from your neighboring farm.

## Much more to come

This is the first draft of the README for the resource section of the valueflows vocabulary. 
We will have a lot more to say about Resources and ResourceTypes, both on their own, 
and also how they behave in Processes and Exchanges, because different ResourceTypes behave very differently.
